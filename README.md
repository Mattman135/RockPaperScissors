# RockPaperScissors.
ü™®, üßª or ‚úÇÔ∏è ?
This repository contains the game rock, paper or scissor. You play against the computer. Best out of five rounds is the winner.

The layout should contain:
- The three options rock, paper or scissor. In the middle.
- It should display the option you choose and also the option of the computer. (middle)
- Total result. (middle)
- Play again button that restarts the game. On the right of the page.
- A neat design.
- It should play a sound when the game is over.
- It should include a copyright section and a link to my GitHub at the bottom of the page.
- It should contain a paragraph section that explains the rules. On the left side of the page.

- I practiced my design-skills in HTML, CSS.
- I learned how to implement logic with JavaScript and make it compatible with a web page.
- Learned how to use addEventListener to be able to click buttons on a web page.
